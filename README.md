# Software-design
## Creational design: 
### Factory Method: 
#### The classes named here are part of the factory method:
- GameSetupCreator.java
- CheckerSetupCreator.java
- ChessSetupCreator.java

## Structural design:
### Bridge:
#### The classes named here are part of the bridge structure:
- Colors.java
- White.java
- Black.java 
In combination with CheckersSetupCreator and both the ChessSetupCreator and the CheckersSetupCreator.
<br>The structural design for a bridge is logical because both the pawns and both the squares of the board, need black and white. So they both get there colors from these classes.
